Bean Scopes:
singelton -> single shared instance of the bean
prototype -> new bean instance for each container request
request -> scoped to an HTTP web request
session -> scoped to an HTTP web request
global-session -> scoped to a global HTTP web session

init-method and destroy-method -> no arg methods

For "prototype" scoped beans, Spring does not call the destroy method. In contrast to the other scopes, Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a prototype bean

To call the destroy method on Prototype beans:
- Create custom processor, put it as a bean
- prototype bean must implement DisposableBean interface

add to config file -> <context:component-scan base-package="com.luv2code.springdemo"/>
bean class -> @Component(<bean-id>)
@Autowired -> any method to dependency injection
